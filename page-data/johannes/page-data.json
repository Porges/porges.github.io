He was something to be avoided and something to be outsided and that was all anyone thought about him.</p>\n<p>This was of course (this being a story about a man a person) no great deal to Johannes himself. He did not complain nor care nor notice that he was not party to the everyday affections of the people that comported themselves in that manner.</p>\n<p>But of course this is both an allegory and a lie those who write about themselves write about another and those who wrote about another write amongst themselves. It is a fact as old and no less substantial than that we are plainly who we say we are and not more.</p>\n<p>(Johannes then must be a figure a archetype a rival against and even if these more so than myself for it is in writing what we wish to write about in which unwritten is that which we truly wish to write about and that which we ourselves remain unwritten)</p>\n<p>This of course is bullshit. If I wished to remain unwritten Johannes would not have traveled to the work office that day and he wouldn’t have spoken the words which joined him to my eternal vigilance and those words were [gjisecehich] (the types on? [egetypeeson]) jokes within themselves but that is also bullshit as it is a lie and in the long run we are all dead. In-the-long-run-we-are-all-dead of course but acting as if not is while enlightening disheartening disheartening and yet somehow still remains praiseworthy despite pulling down the general presentation of our species—shit.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Johannes has explained himself. Hello he has said hello my name is Johannes &#x26; who might you be &#x26; I am a man who has grown &#x26; yet is not useful.</p>\n<p>There are only so many places a man like (Johannes) can be placed you know?</p>\n<p>Yes and it is true I have not been placed</p>\n<p>Well?</p>\n<p>At all in the past</p>\n<p>At all?</p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p>We have not seen such negligence in a long time<br/>\nare you crippled or with child</p>\n<p>No said Johannes I am a man</p>\n<p>At this point Johannes was already but he said little did he know what he was saying would like a job\nand this was something he had heard of and also that he would like to be a man because that was also something he has heard of.</p>\n<p>He was offered a role &#x26; he took it.</p>\n<p>Johannes neither there was an everyman but he could not be more when he became.</p>\n<p>His role was that of a job and his job was that of a man and he did his role but he waited his job and he didn’t but then know what his role was or how he came to be here.
